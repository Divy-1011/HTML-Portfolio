<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey, I’m Divy. I’m into cars, hitting the gym, building a watch collection, and keeping active whenever I can. Outside of that, I love going out, hanging with friends, and spending time with family—it’s the little moments that count. I’m curious by nature, always up for trying new things, exploring ideas, or just having a good laugh. This is my space to share the things I’m into, the stuff I create, and the journey I’m on.</p>
